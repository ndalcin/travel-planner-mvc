# travel-planner-mvc
MVC Sinatra Application for Flatiron's FSWD Sinatra Portfolio Project

##Thoughts
I built this *very* basic application as an extension to first project, CLI Data Gem- Flight Deals. I thought that for this project, a user could start to plan a trip by keeping track of their budget, number of travelers, and flight departure city. Eventually, it would be cool for a user to enter this information, and then someone from the site could plan their ideal trip... but maybe next project :P
